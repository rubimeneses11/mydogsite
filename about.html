        <p>He's the oldest of the pack but in his mind he is the one and only. Hates to be left out of a hug. Requests to be in every team meeting. Wants to sun bathe all day while he baby-sits his chuck-it ball and would also love it if we would stop bringing in other "strays" into his home. 10/10 certified good boy.

      <p>Cute and he knows it. Sometimes scared of people, sometimes barks to sniff them. Let's see what it is today. Loves a good cozy blanket and will make anything into a dog bed. Sleeps all day if he could because it is absolutely hard work supervising the the day to day of a human. If you want to be his friend, ignore him or bring him food. Perferrably, the food.

      <p>Not for the first time dog owner. Not about the "pitbulls are just nanny dogs" slogan. She's real. She's a lover and you bet, she's a fighter. She does everything with every fiber of her being. Tries very hard to be a good girl but will not fit into your cookie cutter idea of what she should be. She's loyal to few and ignores most. Would go thru a wood chipper for her ball or a treat.
